## 📌 Project Overview
Cassava is a staple food for millions, but viral diseases can devastate entire harvests. This project focuses on building an automated **Computer Vision** pipeline to identify four distinct diseases and distinguish them from healthy plants. 

By applying **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this system serves as a scalable solution for early disease detection, reducing the manual labor of agricultural inspection.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Dataset from Kaggle.

Classes:
*Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)

*Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)

*Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)

*Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)

*Healthy

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

*Data loading and preprocessing

*Image resizing and normalization

*CNN model building

*Model training and validation

*Performance evaluation

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of:

*Convolution layers for feature extraction

*MaxPooling layers to reduce dimensionality

*Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

*Fully connected dense layers for classification

*The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

##  Technical Highlights
### The Pipeline
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized class distributions and identified visual markers for Bacterial Blight vs. Mosaic Disease.
2. **Data Augmentation:** To combat over-fitting, I implemented real-time augmentations (rotation, zoom, and horizontal flips) using `ImageDataGenerator`.
3. **Model Architecture:** Leveraged a custom **CNN architecture** (or transfer learning) optimized for high-resolution leaf images.

### 🚀 Challenges Overcome
* **Class Imbalance:** Handled datasets where certain diseases were more prevalent than others to ensure the model didn't become biased.
* **Feature Similarity:** Fine-tuned the model to distinguish between subtle brown streaks and bacterial spots which look similar to the naked eye.
